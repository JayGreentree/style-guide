Marketing Request Guide
=======================

A resource to help you with your marketing requests.

### NorthPointe Style Guide
### Writing with Clarity

[Clarity App](http://clarityapp.northpointe.org/) makes your writing clear, positive, and easy to understand. It's like spellcheck, but for style. It makes sure that your reader will focus on your message, not your prose.

Too often, our words are like our thoughts — innumerable and disorganized. Almost any bit of writing could use some cutting. Less is more, etc.

The Clarity App will highlight where your writing is too dense or complicated. Try removing needless words or splitting the sentence into two. Your readers will thank you.

## Once Your Request is Submitted

### The Approval Process

- The Creative Director will schedule your marketing request within 3 business days.
- During this 3-day period, Paul will work with you to decide the best ways to market your event.
- Requests are not automatically approved. There are many factors to consider: paper availability, production workload, etc. Requests are prioritized within the ministry and communication strategy of NorthPointe Church.

### Communicating through Asana

- Asana allows us to get the right amount of information in front of the people working on your project. After approval, requests are assigned to team members responsible for parts of your project. Commenting on tasks provides a central location for everything about project. It keeps the Creative Team on the same page, and keeps you from having to repeat yourself over email.
- If you’re following a task, you’ll be able to track conversations and work happening on your requests.
- If you have a question about Asana, please ask someone on our Creative team. We’d be happy to help you get comfortable using Asana as a communication tool.

### Updating Requests through Asana
- Once your request is in Asana, you can update the creative team using comments. Please don’t change the contents, or due date of your task, original information helps us make sure the changes make it to the final product.
