NorthPointe Style
=================

Hi! If you work at NorthPointe you’re communicating every day. Whether you’re writing an email, blog post, or something else, this guide will cover some grammar basics, explain the types of content we publish, and give you a sense of NorthPointe’s personality. Consider this a set of standards to help you write solid and engaging content that suits our church—they’re not hard and fast rules. We’d rather be clear, informative, and entertaining writers than grammar nerds any day, so don’t get caught up in technicalities. And have fun!


Voice and Tone
--------------

NorthPointe's voice is human. It’s familiar, it’s friendly, and it’s straightforward. Our voice is simply an extension of the platform on Sunday morning. In everything we do, we want to inspire and inform people to action. We inspire action by using language that educates and empowers people without patronizing or confusing them.

NorthPointe is “Creating a positive faith environment where non-churchgoers are encouraged to become fully-developing followers of Jesus Christ at every stage of life.” and that spirit should come through in every piece of content we produce.

**NorthPointe is:**

- Welcoming, but not gushing
- Informal, but not sloppy
- Optimistic, but not unrealistic
- Conversational, but not rambling
- Informative, but not academic
- Stylish, but not inaccessible


### Watch your tone
There’s a difference between voice and tone. Look at it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might speak in one tone to your closest friends and family, and a different tone with your boss. Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing. Same goes for NorthPointe's voice. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.
When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Adjust your tone accordingly.

#### Be True
- We don’t lie  
- We don’t over promise or bend the truth  
*Our writing doesn’t bend the truth or use excessive adjectives. Because things that are “totally epic” usually aren’t*. 
- We Stick to the facts

#### Be nice
We’re experts, but we’re not bossy.  
We wouldn’t say:  You must log in before you are allowed to give.  
Instead, we’d say:  Looking for a way to give? Log in to NPCC.me

We keep it positive.  
We wouldn’t say:  You can’t sign up for Core Class 201 until you’ve completed 101.  
Instead, we’d say: To get started with Core Classes, sign up for 101.


Writing for NorthPointe
=======================

When you finish writing an article read it out loud to yourself. That might sound like a silly exercise, but it's important we maintain an approachable tone.



That’s where copywriting comes in.



Some tips: Picture your audience and write for them. It’s not about you. Tell a story. Paint a picture. It’s far more memorable. Your copy is a roadmap that can’t afford detours. So, make a single point.

Say what’s important. Forget the rest.

> “You want hearts, not eyeballs.” - Austin Kleon, *Show Your Work*

1. Use present tense: “NorthPointe gives”, and the present perfect: “We’ve meticulously crafted”
2. Write from the first person plural perspective: we, not they
3. Be brief and speak directly.
4. Avoid exclamation points. If you must exclaim, use words that do the exclaiming for you.
5. Never use all caps (unless it’s an abbreviation).


#### Inform.
#### Inspire.
#### Read it out loud.
Is it clear?
Is it useful?
Is it friendly?
Is it true?


Writing for the Web
-------------------

Don't skip the research. Know your stuff.
Understand what you're saying and where you're saying it. A website is not the same as an invite.

Use the inverted pyramid style (Information/content flows top to bottom from most important to least important)
Use short phrases
Use active voice
Never use _click on_ or _click here_

### Blog Posts

Imagine if we had the ability to speak into the lives of people and encourage them to become fully-developing followers of Jesus Christ… every day. Blogs and articles extend the pulpit to help people understand the Bible and take steps forward as they follow Christ Monday through Saturday.

#### Three Values for Blog Writing
**1. Simple**

- Write like you are talking to your neighbors, coworkers, family, and friends. A great question to ask: If I said this to a middle school student, would he or she understand?

**2. Biblical**

- We don’t do self-help. We share the Gospel. Everything we write should help people connect to God and better understand the Bible.

**3. Practical**

- Everyone has a next step in his or her walk with Jesus. Does your piece encourage readers to take a next step?
- Can the reader apply what you’ve written today?

#### Writer’s Checklist
Before turning in an article or devotional, ask yourself these questions:

1. Does my blog post convey one simple idea?
2. Are my points backed by Scripture?
3. Did I give the reader a clear next step?
4. Am I referencing people or places guests won’t understand? 
5. Is my post on a 7th to 8th grade reading level?
6. Did I keep to the word limit (300 words for devotionals and 500 words for articles) and format?
*Please fact-check your work before turning it in. Double check names, numbers, Scripture references, and spelling*.​

### Events

A well written event page is worth its weight in gold. It can inform people who are already going, and convince guests who are on the fence about going.

#### Start with Why.
First identify who your ideal attendees are. Once you’ve narrowed your target demographic, it makes it easier to answer these questions:

- What makes your event different?
- Why would someone want to attend?
- What will attendees get out of your event?

#### How and What.
Pretend you know nothing about your event. Include the important details: date, time, venue name, address, etc. But also think about the other things your attendees might want to know: Do guests need to register? Do they need to bring anything? Is there childcare?

Explain the format, make sure to be clear about what people are signing up for.

If you’re not sure if you should include something, you can never provide too many details.

#### Read it.
Read everything you’ve written out loud. Everything you write will make perfect sense to you, but when you read something out loud, you get a better sense of how a guest is going to understand it. If it doesn’t sound like something you’d say, consider rewriting. Double check to make sure your spelling, grammar, and punctuation is correct.

#### Quick Tips
- Keep your titles to less than 50 characters including spaces.
- Write in short paragraphs.
- Use words that are absolutely inclusive, and point to the future. (*Join us* is an invitation to an event already in progress)
- Don’t start with what you’ll learn, start with why you’d want to learn it.

Writing for Email
-----------------

Email at NorthPointe should be clear, concise, and fast. Most people are busy, and we don’t want to tie them up any longer than necessary. Don’t write lengthy novels, or include information they don’t need. Focus on communicating in the shortest period possible.

If you communicate clearly, you’ll be concise. And if you’re concise, you’ll be fast.

### Personal Email
- Respond quickly. Aim to respond to emails within a work day. If you’re unavailable, set an out-of-office notification.
- Write in short paragraphs, with no more than 300 words.
- Use expressive and compelling subject lines. Leaders like _For Approval:, Meeting Request:, or FYI:_ indicate what action is needed.
- Email stationary, or non-default fonts add unnecessary clutter and should be removed.

#### Identify the Main Point or Action Item
- Before you begin the email, condense what you want your audience to know in one or two sentences.
- The “why” of your email should not be more than one or two sentences.
- Vision is important to include in your emails, but make sure you don’t bury critical information underneath unnecessary sentences.
- Make it as easy as possible for your reader to pinpoint what they need to know or do, either by writing it towards the beginning of the content, or by formatting it in **bold face**.

#### Be Mindful of Your Tone
- Your choice words, sentence length, punctuation, and capitalization can easily be misinterpreted without visual and auditory cues.
- The cleaner and more concise you can get your email, the better your conversation is going to be.

#### Consider Your Audience
- Always aim the language towards your newest or least informed recipient. If you are sending an email to an entire team of volunteers, communicate at the level of the person who joined last week. They may not be familiar with the language you would normally use with someone who has been working with NorthPointe for a year.

#### Always Proofread Before Sending
- Double check to make sure your spelling, punctuation, and grammar is correct.

### Email Signature

**Default signature**:

> **John Smith**  
Administrative Assistant  
[NorthPointe Community Church](https://www.northpointe.org)  
(559) 276-2300  

**Acceptable for responses**:

> **John Smith**  | Administrative Assistant  
[NorthPointe Community Church](https://www.northpointe.org)  


### Email Campaigns

#### Guidelines

##### From name
Usually _NorthPointe Community Church_ or the ministry name. It identifies the sender in the recipient’s inbox.

##### Subject line
Keep your subject line descriptive. There’s no perfect length, but some email clients only display the first words. Tell what’s inside. 

##### Preheader text
The top line of your email appears beside each subject line in the inbox. Provide the info readers need when they’re deciding if they should open.

##### Body copy
Keep your content concise. Write with a clear purpose, and connect each paragraph to your main idea. Add images when they’re helpful.

##### Call to action
Make the next step clear. If you’re asking people to go to something, read something, share something, or respond to something, offer a clear direction to close your message so readers know what to do next.

##### Footer
All campaigns follow CAN-SPAM rules. Include an unsubscribe link, mailing address, and permission reminder in the footer of each newsletter.


#### Process
1. Send a copywriter the body of the email to proof.


Writing for the Bulletin
------------------------

Every non-churchgoer has a first Sunday. A morning where they walk in *(early)*, grab a bulletin, sit down, and start picking through it. 
They're apprehensive, nervous, maybe a bit anxious. NorthPointe is all about reaching these guests, and the bulletin is our opportunity to put them at ease.

**Quick Tips**

- Write as warmly and clearly as possible. Only use church jargon when it's absolutely necessary.
- Avoid history, but look to the future. Keep in mind: every week is someone’s first Sunday. 
- Start with what’s important, leave out the rest.


### Good Vs Bad

#### Bad

> **NorthPointe 25TH Anniversary!**  
NorthPointe Community Church is celebrating their 25th anniversary on September 21 at 6pm in Grizzly Stadium. God has done so much for us in 25 years at NorthPointe. 

- No need for exclamation points in a well-crafted headline
- No need to lead with “NorthPointe Community Church” or include its location
- No clarity on what the product delivers
- No reason for our audience to care
- No call to action

#### Good

> **Get Ready to Celebrate.**  
Over the past twenty-five years of
ministry at NorthPointe God has
been powerfully at work in our midst,
transforming countless lives into the image
of His Son. And we each have a part in this
story. Join us 6pm Saturday, Sept 21 at Grizzly Stadium. 

- Headline speaks directly to the audience
- Prompts involvement from the reader
“we each have a part…”
- Invites the audience to experience something different and new
- Compels with careful choice of words
- Offers a clear call to action



### Bulletin writing tips

#### 1. Inform

*Name and purpose*

- 	What is it?
- 	Who is it for? How will it help them?

*Details*

- When and Where is the event?
- Is childcare provided?
- How much does it cost? Where can you sign up?


#### 2. Inspire
- Start with why
- Be honest about the event
- Adjectives don’t do you any favors.

#### 3. Read it out loud
Check for these basics:

- Is it clear?
- Is it active (and not passive)?
- Does it sound like NorthPointe?
- Is every word true?
- Can you cut any adjectives or modifiers?
- Does it respect our audience?

Take out any white lies or fluff. Watch out for filler words like *especially* etc

When our guests read the bulletin we want to respect them, and welcome them into the life of the church. They want to be informed, not mothered or lectured. Lose the excessively prescriptive and the moralizing, because it can come off as condescending.

- Don’t forget…
- We need… 
- Never…
- Avoid…
- Don’t…
- Remember to… 

Edit your work until it’s clear, honest, and sounds like something you’d say to a friend or neighbor. Tell them how you really feel, and be patient with yourself while you rework the copy.


### Formatting

- *Dates* - Saturday, Nov 16 or Every Saturday
- *Times* - 6:30pm, 6pm (No space or periods)

#### Bulletin Blacklist

- NPCC (Only acceptable for social media, and web to differentiate from North Point Atlanta)
- Ministry
- “Air Quotes”

Grammar and Mechanics
----------------

Grammar is hard, but following certain rules keeps our writing clear and consistent. This section lays out our house style, which applies to all our content unless otherwise noted in this guide.

### Guidelines

#### Abbreviations and acronyms
If there’s a chance a reader won’t recognize an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time. If the abbreviation is more common than the long form, then use the short form (DVD)  

*Never use NPCC*

#### Capitalization
Use common sense. When in doubt, don’t capitalize. All caps is like yelling, just say no. Do *not* capitalize these words: website, internet, online, email. Capitalize pronouns when referencing God. *Examples: Creator, God, Father, Holy Sprit, He, Him, His*

##### Biblical Capitalization

- Capitalize _Bible_ when referring to the Scriptures in the Old or New Testament.
- Capitalize related terms such as the _Gospels, Gospel of John, the Scriptures_.
- Lowercase _biblical_ in all uses.
- Uppercase pronouns related to God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit. E.g. _He, Him, His,_ etc.
- Lowercase _god_ when referring to deities or idols of polytheistic religions.
- Lowercase such words as _godly, godlike, godliness,_ _godsend._
- Capitalize names of major events in the life of Jesus Christ that do not use His name_,_ e.g. _the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, and the Ascension_.
- Lowercase _heaven, hell, devil, angel, apostle, priest, etc._
- Capitalize _Hades_ and _Satan_.

#### Contractions
Use them!

#### Dates

- Capitalize month names in all uses.
- Spell out the day and abbreviate the month. *Sunday, Jan 24*
- Do not ordinalize dates by adding _st,nd,_ or _th_ 
- Ranges
	- For "pure" ranges, use an En Dash with no space on either side.
	- For date ranges in the same month _January 5–6, 2015_
	- Year Ranges _2014–2015_
	- Month Ranges _May–June 2015_
	- Between specific dates in different months _January 10 – August 18, 2015_
	- Between dates in different years _January 1, 1908 – August 1, 2012_

### Punctuation

#### Ampersands (&)
Do not use in place of _and_, except as part of a graphic design or logo.

#### Apostrophe

- Avoid using apostrophes in plural acronyms, e.g. _CDs, URLs_
- Plural nouns not ending in _s_: Add _’s_, e.g. _the alumni’s contributions, women’s rights._
- Plural nouns ending in _s_: Add only an apostrophe: _the churches’ needs, the girls’ toys, the horses’ food, the ships’ wake, states’ rights, the VIPs’ entrance_.
- For consistency and ease in remembering a rule, always use _’s_ if the word does not end in the letter _s_.
- Singular proper names ending in _s_: Use only an apostrophe, e.g. _Jesus’ disciples._
- When a proper noun is already plural, the usual rule for possessives applies, e.g. _The Smiths’, Rolling Stones’_.

#### At Sign (@)
Do not use in place of _at_, except as part of a Twitter, Instagram, or email address.

#### Commas
Use the oxford or serial comma.

> We interviewed some of our members, Rick Warren, Oprah, and Justin Timberlake.

Otherwise, follow common sense with commas. Read the sentence aloud. If you need to take a breath, use a comma.

#### Emoji
Emoji are a fun way to add humor and interest to your writing, but use them infrequently. Currently emoji are only supported in social media and email contexts.

#### Em Dashes (—)
Use as an abrupt change in a thought or sentence. No space on either side (_On second thought—I don’t agree_). For Mac, use shortcut `shift+option+-`, for Windows, use shortcut `alt+0151`.

#### En Dashes (–)
Use mainly for time and date ranges. No space on either side (_The event is from 9–5pm_). For Mac, use shortcut `option+-`, for Windows, use shortcut `alt+0150`.

#### End Marks
Use only one space between an end mark (period, question mark, or exclamation point) and the beginning of a new sentence—never two. Omit periods in incomplete sentences.

#### Exclamation points
Go easy on the exclamation points! Only use exclamation points when you’re basically giving someone a high five. Never use them in titles or headings.

#### Hyphens (-)
Use a hyphen whenever ambiguity would result if it were omitted: T​he president will speak to small-business men. (​Businessmen​ normally is one word. But t​he president will speak to small businessmen​ makes it sound like the businessmen are small.)

#### Italics
Italicize to emphasize a word, cite an example or indicate the title of a long work (books, movies, albums).

Scripture should be Italicized. 

#### Pronouns
Don’t use “they” or “one” as singular pronouns. Use “she” or “he” or avoid it altogether.

#### Underlining
Don’t underline things.

### Formatting

#### Addresses
**One Line**  
2787 W. Bullard Ave., Suite 101 Fresno, CA 93711

**Multiple Line**  
2787 W. Bullard Ave.  
Suite 101  
Fresno, CA 93711

#### Email
Use all lowercase for email addresses.  
*johndoe@northpointe.org*

Never publish personal email addresses. Email should only be publicized for direct and personal contact. Call to action requests (i.e. RSVP, Register) should use a form.

#### Job Titles
When mentioning someone on the NorthPointe staff, always introduce the title after the first mention of their name. _It was written by Todd Anderson, Worship Pastor._ The second mention should only use their first name.

#### Numbers
- Spell out numbers one through nine and use numerals for 10 and above.
- Ages: Use numerals for specific ages (“The 5-year-old had a party,” “She was turning 30”)
- Spell out decades _in your thirties_, _The twenty-somethings_
- Use a hyphen for a span of numbers. *It takes 20-30 days*

#### Telephone numbers
For internal (bulletin) use: 650-2000 ext. 213  
For external (web) use: (559) 650-2000 ext. 213  

Note: Never publish personal phone numbers. Always use a NorthPointe phone number and extension.

#### Times
Use numerals and am or pm without a space. Don’t use minutes for on-the hour times. _7am, 10:30pm_
Use a hyphen between times to indicate a time period.  
_7am-10:30pm_
_7-10am_

#### Web Addresses
Always lowercase, and italicize. Drop the _http://www._
When the URL doesn’t fit on one line, break it into two or more lines without adding a hyphen or other punctuation mark.  
If the URL is the last word in a paragraph, do not add punctuation to the end of the sentence.
_northpointe.org_


### Biblical Style

- The Holman Christian Standard Bible (HCSB) is the preferred version of NorthPointe Church.
- Whether using HCSB or another version, always cite the version after the verse.

#### Scripture References
Never abbreviate books of the Bible _Mark 3:21, Luke 2:10-11_

- No space after colon: Matthew 5:5-7
- Nonconsecutive verses: Matthew 5:5,7 (no space after comma)
- Consecutive verses: Matthew 5:5-6
- Consecutive chapters: Genesis 1-5
- Nonconsecutive chapters: Genesis 1; 5 and/or Exodus 5:1; 12:14-17 (semicolons usually divide chapters)
- Consecutive verses that span chapters: Isaiah 1:5-2:4
- Place the end-of-sentence period after the Scripture
reference, not at the end of quote: “Jesus wept” (John
11:35). 
- When part of quote is omitted at end of sentence, the first ellipsis period comes at the end of the last word (as if it were the period) and then put space between other ellipses: “For God so loved. . .” (John 3:16).
- If the quoted phrase ends with a comma or semicolon, add it and then two periods, the reference, and then the third period: “For God so loved the world, . .” (John 3:16).
- The correct position of the question mark is: “What must we do, to be doing the works of God” (John 6:28, RSV)?
- Use a or b with a verse number: Only when the reference is cited and the verse is not quoted: See John 3:16a for a reference to God’s love. But if part of the verse is quoted, use the verse reference only: “For God so loved. . .” (John 3:16).
- When referring to a Scripture within the text: In 1 John 4:7 (NIV), we read, “Dear Friends, let us love one another.”
- When referring to a Scripture, but not quoting it: the Bible has many references to God’s love (see John 3:16).

When citing translations use capitalized abbreviation ESV, NIV, MSG, NASB, etc. _Mark 3:21 (ESV)_

#### Bible

- **Use:**
	- Studies
	- Scripture
	- Reading Plans
	- Bible, biblical
- **Avoid:**
	- God’s Word
	- quiet time
	- resources

#### Names of God

- Holy Spirit - Never Holy Ghost
- Jesus’ - use apostrophe but no _s_ when making Jesus possessive (e.g. Jesus’ disciples)
