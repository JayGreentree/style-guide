NorthPointe Style
=================

Hi! If you work at NorthPointe you’re communicating every day. Whether you’re writing an email, blog post, or something else, this guide will cover some grammar basics, explain the types of content we publish, and give you a sense of NorthPointe’s personality. Consider this a set of standards to help you write solid and engaging content that suits our church—they’re not hard and fast rules. We’d rather be clear, informative, and entertaining writers than grammar nerds any day, so don’t get caught up in technicalities. And have fun!


Voice and Tone
--------------

NorthPointe's voice is human. It’s familiar, it’s friendly, and it’s straightforward. Our voice is simply an extension of the platform on Sunday morning. In everything we do, we want to inspire and inform people to action. We inspire action by using language that educates and empowers people without patronizing or confusing them.

NorthPointe is “Creating a positive faith environment where non-churchgoers are encouraged to become fully-developing followers of Jesus Christ at every stage of life.” and that spirit should come through in every piece of content we produce.

NorthPointe is:

- Welcoming, but not gushing
- Informal, but not sloppy
- Optimistic, but not unrealistic
- Conversational, but not rambling
- Informative, but not academic
- Stylish, but not inaccessible


### Watch your tone
There’s a difference between voice and tone. Look at it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might speak in one tone to your closest friends and family, and a different tone with your boss. Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing. Same goes for NorthPointe's voice. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.
When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Adjust your tone accordingly.

#### Be True
- We don’t lie  
- We don’t over promise or bend the truth  
*Our writing doesn’t bend the truth or use excessive adjectives. Because things that are “totally epic” usually aren’t*. 
- We Stick to the facts

#### Be nice
We’re experts, but we’re not bossy.  
We wouldn’t say:  You must log in before you are allowed to give.  
Instead, we’d say:  Looking for a way to give? Log in to NPCC.me

We keep it positive.  
We wouldn’t say:  You can’t sign up for Core Class 201 until you’ve completed 101.  
Instead, we’d say: To get started with Core Classes, sign up for 101.


Writing for NorthPointe
=======================

When you finish writing an article read it out loud to yourself. That might sound like a silly exercise, but it's important we maintain an approachable tone.



That’s where copywriting comes in.



Some tips: Picture your audience and write for them. It’s not about you. Tell a story. Paint a picture. It’s far more memorable. Your copy is a roadmap that can’t afford detours. So, make a single point.

Say what’s important. Forget the rest.

“You want hearts, not eyeballs.” - Austin Kleon, *Show Your Work*

1. Use present tense: “NorthPointe gives”, and the present perfect: “We’ve meticulously crafted”
2. Write from the first person plural perspective: we, not they
3. Be brief and speak directly.
4. Avoid exclamation points. If you must exclaim, use words that do  the exclaiming for you.
5. Never use all caps (unless it’s an abbreviation).


#### Inform.
#### Inspire.
#### Read it out loud.
Is it clear?
Is it useful?
Is it friendly?
Is it true?


Writing for the web
-------------------

Don't skip the research. Know your stuff.
Understand what you're saying and where you're saying it. A website is not the same as an invite.

Use the inverted pyramid style (Information/content flows top to bottom from most important to least important)
Use short phrases
Use active voice
Never use "click on" or "click here"

### Blog Posts

> “Part of the struggle in learning to write is learning to ignore what isn’t useful to you and pay attention to what is…This is a book full of starting points. Perhaps they’ll help you find enough clarity in your own mind and your own writing to discover what it means to write. I don’t mean ‘write the way I do’ or ‘write the way they do.’ I mean ‘write the way you do.’” - *Verlyn Klinkenborg*

#### Just Write

When you’re done writing:

- Read it out loud
- Aim for clarity over brevity
- **Craft a headline** - Be direct, but nice.

Writing for the Bulletin
------------------------

Every non-churchgoer has a first Sunday. A morning where they walk in *(early)*, grab a bulletin, sit down, and start picking through it. 
They're apprehensive, nervous, maybe a bit anxious. NorthPointe is all about reaching these guests, and the bulletin is our opportunity to put them at ease.

**Quick Tips**

- Write as warmly and clearly as possible. Only use church jargon when it's absolutely necessary.
- Avoid history, but look to the future. Keep in mind: every week is someone’s first Sunday. 
- Start with what’s important, leave out the rest.


### Good Vs Bad

#### Bad

**NORTHPOINTE 25TH ANNIVERSARY!**  
NorthPointe Community Church is celebrating their 25th anniversary on September 21 at 6pm in Grizzly Stadium. God has done so much for us in 25 years at NorthPointe. 

> - No need for exclamation points in a well-crafted headline
- No need to lead with “NorthPointe Community Church” or include its location
- No clarity on what the product delivers
- No reason for our audience to care
- No call to action

#### Good

**GET READY TO CELEBRATE.**  
Over the past twenty-five years of
ministry at NorthPointe God has
been powerfully at work in our midst,
transforming countless lives into the image
of His Son. And we each have a part in this
story. Join us 6pm Saturday, Sept 21 at Grizzly Stadium. 


> - Headline speaks directly to the audience
- Prompts involvement from the reader
“we each have a part...”
- Invites the audience to experience something different and new
- Compels with careful choice of words
- Offers a clear call to action



### Bulletin writing tips

#### 1. Inform

*Name and purpose*

- 	What is it?
- 	Who is it for? How will it help them?

*Details*

- When and Where is the event?
- Is childcare provided?
- How much does it cost? Where can you sign up?


#### 2. Inspire
- 	Be honest about the event
- 	Adjectives don’t do you any favors.

#### 3. Read it out loud
Check for these basics:

- Is it clear?
- Is it active (and not passive)?
- Does it sound like NorthPointe?
- Is every word true?
- Can you cut any adjectives or modifiers?
- Does it respect our audience?

Take out any white lies or fluff. Watch out for filler words like *especially* etc

When our guests read the bulletin we want to respect them, and welcome them into the life of the church. They want to be informed, not mothered or lectured. Lose the excessively prescriptive and the moralizing, because it can come off as condescending.

- Don’t forget…
- We need… 
- Never…
- Avoid…
- Don’t…
- Remember to… 

Edit your work until it’s clear, honest, and sounds like something you’d say to a friend or neighbor. Tell them how you really feel, and be patient with yourself while you rework the copy.


### Formatting

- *Dates* - Saturday, Nov 16 or Every Saturday // DEVELOPING
- *Times* - 6:30pm, 6pm (No space or periods)

#### Bulletin Blacklist

Grammar and More
----------------

Grammar is hard.

### Grammar and Punctuation

#### Abbreviations and acronyms
If there’s a chance a reader won’t recognize an abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time. If the abbreviation is more common than the long form, then use the short form (DVD)  
*Never use NPCC*

#### Ampersands (&)
Do not use in place of _and_, except as part of a graphic design or logo.

#### Apostrophe

- Avoid using apostrophes in plural acronyms, e.g. _CDs, URLs_
- Plural nouns not ending in _s_: Add _’s_, e.g. _the alumni’s contributions, women’s rights._
- Plural nouns ending in _s_: Add only an apostrophe: _the churches’ needs, the girls’ toys, the horses’ food, the ships’ wake, states’ rights, the VIPs’ entrance_.
- For consistency and ease in remembering a rule, always use _’s_ if the word does not end in the letter _s_.
- Singular proper names ending in _s_: Use only an apostrophe, e.g. _Jesus’ disciples._
- When a proper noun is already plural, the usual rule for possessives applies, e.g. _The Smiths’, Rolling Stones’_.

#### Capitalization
Use common sense. When in doubt, don’t capitalize. All caps is like yelling, just say no. Do *not* capitalize these words: website, internet, online, email. Capitalize pronouns when referencing God. *Examples: Creator, God, Father, Holy Sprit, He, Him, His*

##### Biblical Capitalization

- Capitalize _Bible_ when referring to the Scriptures in the Old or New Testament.
- Capitalize related terms such as the _Gospels, Gospel of John, the Scriptures_.
- Lowercase _biblical_ in all uses.
- Uppercase pronouns related to God, Jesus, or the Holy Spirit. E.g. _He, Him, His,_ etc.
- Lowercase _god_ when referring to deities or idols of polytheistic religions.
- Lowercase such words as _godly, godlike, godliness,_ _godsend._
- Capitalize names of major events in the life of Jesus Christ that do not use His name_,_ e.g. _the Last Supper, the Crucifixion, the Resurrection, and the Ascension_.
- Lowercase _heaven, hell, devil, angel, apostle, priest, etc._
- Capitalize _Hades_ and _Satan_.

#### Commas
Use the oxford or serial comma.

> We interviewed some of our members, Rick Warren, Oprah, and Justin Timberlake.

Otherwise, follow common sense with commas. Read the sentence aloud. If you need to take a breath, use a comma.

#### Contractions
Use them!

#### Dates
Spell out the day and abbreviate the month. *Sunday, Jan 24*

#### Em Dashes (—)
Use as an abrupt change in a thought or sentence. No space on either side (_On second thought—I don’t agree_). For Mac, use shortcut “shift+option+-,” for Windows, use shortcut “alt+0151.”

#### En Dashes (–)
Use mainly for time and date ranges. No space on either side (_The event is from 9–5pm_). For Mac, use shortcut “option+-,” for Windows, use shortcut “alt+0150.”

#### Exclamation points
Go easy on the exclamation points! Only use exclamation points when you’re basically giving someone a high five. Never use them in titles or headings.

#### Hyphens (-)


#### Italics
Italicize to emphasize a word, cite an example or indicate the title of a long work (books, movies, albums).

Scripture should be Italicized. 


#### Numbers
Spell out numbers one through nine and use numerals for 10 and above.  
Use a hyphen for a span of numbers. *It takes 20-30 days*

#### Pronouns
Don’t use “they” or “one” as singular pronouns. Use “she” or “he” or avoid it altogether.

#### Underlining
Don’t underline things.

### Formatting

2787 W. Bullard Ave., Suite 101 Fresno, CA 93711

Use a hyphen between times to indicate a time period.  
7am-10:30pm
7-10am
