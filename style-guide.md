Have fun!


Voice and Tone
--------------

NorthPointe's voice is human. It’s familiar, it’s friendly, and it’s straightforward. Our priority is to inspire and inform people to...

We use language that educates and empowers people without patronizing or confusing them.

NorthPointe is “Creating a positive faith environment where non-churchgoers are encouraged to become fully-developing followers of Jesus Christ at every stage of life.” and that spirit should come through in every piece of content we produce.

NorthPointe is:

- Informal, but not sloppy
- Informative, but not academic
- Welcoming, but not gushing
- Stylish, but not inaccessible
- Crisp, but not trendy


### Watch your tone
There’s a difference between voice and tone. Look at it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might speak in one tone to your closest friends and family, and a different tone with your boss. Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing. Same goes for NorthPointe's voice. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.
When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Adjust your tone accordingly.


### Be nice
We’re experts, but we’re not bossy.  
We wouldn’t say:  You must log in before you are allowed to give.  
Instead, we’d say:  Looking for your give? Log in to NPCC.me

We keep it positive.  
We wouldn’t say:  You can’t send a campaign if you don’t have a list of subscribers.  
Instead, we’d say: Upload a list of subscribers to get started on your first campaign.


Writing for NorthPointe
=======================

When you finish writing an article read it out loud to yourself. That might sound like a silly exercise, but it's important we maintain an approachable tone.


Writing for the web
-------------------

Don't skip the research. Know your stuff.
Unerstand what you're saying and where you're saying it. A website is not the same as an invite.

Use the inverted pyramid style (Information/content flows top to bottom from most important to least important)
Use short phrases
Use active voice
Never use "click on" or "click here"

Writing for the Bulletin
------------------------

Every non-churchgoer has a first Sunday. A morning where they walk in *(early)*, grab a bulletin, sit down, and start picking through it. 
They're apprehensive, nervous, anxious... 

**Quick Tips**

- Write as warmly and clearly as possible. Only use church jargon when it's absolutely necessary.
- Avoid history, but look to the future. 
- Get to the point.


On Sunday mornings we interact with 

NorthPointe is all about reaching non-churchgoers and the bulletin is our opportunity 

### Good Vs Bad

#### Bad

**NORTHPOINTE 25TH ANNIVERSARY!**

their 25th anniversary on September 21 at 6pm in
Grizzly Stadium. God has
done so much for us in 25 years at NorthPointe.

- No reason for our audience to care
- No call to action

#### Good

**GET READY TO CELEBRATE.**

ministry at NorthPointe God has
been powerfully at work in our midst,
transforming countless lives into the image
of His Son. And we each have a part in this
story. Join us 6pm Saturday, September 21 at Grizzly Stadium.

“we each have a part...”

- Compels with careful choice of words
- Offers a clear call to action



### Bulletin writing tips

#### 1. Inform

*Name and purpose*

- 	What is it?
- 	Who is it for? How will it help them?

*Details*

- When and Where is the event?
- Is childcare provided?
- How much does it cost? Where can you sign up?


#### 2. Inspire
- 	Be honest about the event
- 	Adjectives don’t do you any favors.

#### 3. Read it out loud
Check for these basics:

- Is it clear?
- Does it sound like you?
- Is every word true?
- Can you cut any adjectives or modifiers?

Take out any white lies or fluff. Watch out for filler words like *especially* etc

Edit your work until it’s clear, honest, and sounds like something you’d say to a friend or neighbor. Tell them how you really feel, and be patient with yourself while you rework the copy.


### Formatting

- *Dates* - Saturday, 11/16 or Every Saturday
- *Times* - 6:30pm, 6pm (No space or periods)

Grammar and More
----------------

Grammar is hard.

#### Abbreviations and acronyms
If there's a chance a reader won't recognize a abbreviation or acronym, spell it out the first time. If the abbreviation is more common than the long form, then use the short form (DVD)  
*Never use NPCC*

#### Addresses
**One Line**  
2787 W. Bullard Ave., Suite 101 Fresno, CA 93711

**Multiple Line**  
2787 W. Bullard Ave.  
Suite 101  
Fresno, CA 93711

#### Ampersands
Don't use them.

#### Capitalization
Use common sense. When in doubt, don't capitalize. All caps is like yelling, just say no. Do *not* capitalize these words: website, internet, online, email. Capitalize pronouns when referencing God. *Examples: Creator,God, Father, Holy Sprit, He, Him*

#### Commas
Don't use the oxford comma.

We interviewed some of our customers, Oprah and Justin Timberlake.

Otherwise, follow common sense with commas. Read the sentence aloud. If you need to take a breath, use a comma.

#### Contractions
Use them!

#### Dates
Spell out the day and abbreviate the month. *Sunday, Jan. 24*

#### Exclamation points
Go easy on the exclamation points! Only use exclamation points when you're basically giving someone a high five. Never use them in titles or headings.

#### Italics
Italicize to emphasize a word, cite an example or indicate the title of a long work (books, movies, albums)

#### Numbers
Spell out numbers one through nine and use numerals for 10 and above.  
Use a hyphen for a span of numbers. *It takes 20-30 days*

#### Pronouns
Don't use "they" or "one" as singular pronouns. Use "she" or "he" or avoid it altogether.

#### Telephone numbers
Use (559) 650-2000

#### Times
Use numerals and am or pm without a space. Don't use minutes for on-the hour times. *7am 10:30pm*
Use a hyphen between times to indicate a time period.  
7am-10:30pm
7-10am

#### Web Addresses
Always lowercase, never use www  
*northpointe.org*

### Biblical Style

#### Verse References
Never abbreviate books of the Bible *Mark 3:21, Luke 2:10-11*

When citing translations use capitalized abbreviation ESV, NIV, MSG, NASB, etc.
