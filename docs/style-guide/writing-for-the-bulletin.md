# Writing for the Bulletin

Every non-churchgoer has a first Sunday. A morning where they walk in *(early)*, grab a bulletin, sit down, and start picking through it. 
They're apprehensive, nervous, anxious... 

**Quick Tips**

- Write as warmly and clearly as possible. Only use church jargon when it's absolutely necessary.
- Avoid history, but look to the future. 
- Get to the point.

## Bulletin writing tips

### 1. Inform

*Name and purpose*

- 	What is it?
- 	Who is it for? How will it help them?

*Details*

- When and Where is the event?
- Is childcare provided?
- How much does it cost? Where can you sign up?


### 2. Inspire
- 	Honest about the event
- 	Adjectives don’t do you any favors.

### 3. Read it out loud
Check for these basics:

- Is it clear?
- Does it sound like you?
- Is every word true?
- Can you cut any adjectives or modifiers?

Take out any white lies or fluff. Watch out for filler words like *especially* etc

Edit your work until it’s clear, honest, and sounds like something you’d say to a friend or neighbor. Tell them how you really feel, and be patient with yourself while you rework the copy.
