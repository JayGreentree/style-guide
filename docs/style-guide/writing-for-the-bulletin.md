# Writing for the Bulletin

Every non-churchgoer has a first Sunday. A morning where they walk in *(early)*, grab a bulletin, sit down, and start picking through it. 
They're apprehensive, nervous, anxious... 

**Quick Tips**

- Write as warmly and clearly as possible. Only use church jargon when it's absolutely necessary.
- Avoid history, but look to the future. 
- Get to the point.


On Sunday mornings we interact with 

NorthPointe is all about reaching non-churchgoers and the bulletin is our opportunity 

## Good Vs Bad

**Bad**

NORTHPOINTE 25TH ANNIVERSARY!
NorthPointe Community Church is celebrating
their 25th anniversary on September 21 at
Wild Waters in Clovis. God has
done so much for us in 25 years at NorthPointe. 

- No need for exclamation points in a well-crafted headline
- No need to lead with “NorthPointe Community Church” or include its location
- No clarity on what the product delivers
- No reason for our audience to care
- No call to action

**Good**

GET READY TO CELEBRATE.
Over the past twenty-five years of
ministry at NorthPointe God has
been powerfully at work in our midst,
transforming countless lives into the image
of His Son. And we each have a part in this
story. Join us Saturday, September 21 at
Wild Waters in Clovis. 


- Headline speaks directly to the audience
- Prompts involvement from the reader
“we each have a part...”
- Invites the audience to experience something different and new
- Compels with careful choice of words
- Offers a clear call to action



## Bulletin writing tips

### 1. Inform

*Name and purpose*

- 	What is it?
- 	Who is it for? How will it help them?

*Details*

- When and Where is the event?
- Is childcare provided?
- How much does it cost? Where can you sign up?


### 2. Inspire
- 	Honest about the event
- 	Adjectives don’t do you any favors.

### 3. Read it out loud
Check for these basics:

- Is it clear?
- Does it sound like you?
- Is every word true?
- Can you cut any adjectives or modifiers?

Take out any white lies or fluff. Watch out for filler words like *especially* etc

Edit your work until it’s clear, honest, and sounds like something you’d say to a friend or neighbor. Tell them how you really feel, and be patient with yourself while you rework the copy.
