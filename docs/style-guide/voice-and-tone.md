# Voice and Tone

NorthPointe's voice is human. It’s familiar, it’s friendly, and it’s straightforward. Our priority is to inspire and inform people to...

We use language that educates and empowers people without patronizing or confusing them.

NorthPointe is “Creating a positive faith environment where non-churchgoers are encouraged to become fully-developing followers of Jesus Christ at every stage of life.” and that spirit should come through in every piece of content we produce.

NorthPointe is:

- Informal, but not sloppy
- Clear, but not clever
- Informative, but not academic
- Welcoming, but not gushing
- Crisp, but not trendy
- Stylish, but not inaccessible

## Watch your tone
There’s a difference between voice and tone. Look at it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might speak in one tone to your closest friends and family, and a different tone with your boss. Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing. Same goes for NorthPointe's voice. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.
When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Adjust your tone accordingly.
