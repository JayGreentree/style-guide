# Writing for the web

Don't skip the research. Know your stuff.
Unerstand what you're saying and where you're saying it. A website is not the same as an invite.

Use the inverted pyramid style (Information/content flows top to bottom from most important to least important)
Use short phrases
Use active voice
Never use "click on" or "click here"
