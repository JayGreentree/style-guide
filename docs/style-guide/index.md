# Hello.
# Voice and Tone

MailChimp’s voice is human. It’s familiar, it’s friendly, and it’s straightforward. Sure, we crack jokes and tell stories, but our priority is to explain MailChimp and help our users get their work done and get on with their lives. We use language that educates and empowers people without patronizing or confusing them.

We wouldn’t say:  Facebook is a great social-media website where you can create a profile and connect with friends. Facebook and MailChimp can share information, so you can add a MailChimp signup form to your own Facebook page.

Instead, we’d say:  Add a newsletter signup form to your Facebook profile. Here’s how it works.

MailChimp has a sense of humor, so feel free to be funny when it comes naturally to you. Don’t force jokes, though, because forced humor never ends well. We know when to be funny and when to keep a straight face. Our tone is usually informal, but it’s more important to be clear than entertaining.

MailChimp’s unofficial tagline is “Love what you do,” and that spirit should come through in every piece of content we produce.

MailChimp is:
- Fun but not childish
- Clever but not silly
- Confident but not cocky
- Smart but not stodgy
- Cool but not alienating
- Informal but not sloppy
- Helpful but not overbearing
- Expert but not bossy
- Weird but not inappropriate

### Watch your tone
There’s a difference between voice and tone. Look at it this way: You have the same voice all the time, but your tone changes. You might speak in one tone to your closest friends and family, and a different tone with your boss. Your tone also changes depending on the emotional state of the person you’re addressing. You wouldn’t use the same tone of voice with someone who’s scared or upset as you would with someone who’s laughing. Same goes for MailChimp’s voice. Our voice doesn’t change much from day to day, but our tone changes all the time.
When you’re writing, consider the reader’s state of mind. Is she relieved to be finished with a campaign? Mad that she can’t log in? Confused about which merge tag to use? Adjust your tone accordingly.

Be nice
We’re experts, but we’re not bossy.
We wouldn’t say:  You must log in before you are allowed to view your stats.
Instead, we’d say:  Looking for your stats? Log in to MailChimp.
We keep it positive.
We wouldn’t say:  You can’t send a campaign if you don’t have a list of subscribers.
Instead, we’d say: Upload a list of subscribers to get started on your first campaign.
On Freddie
Freddie Von Chimpenheimer IV is the lovable face of MailChimp. He’s been around in various forms since the beginning, and he captures our brand’s personality. He’s got a smile on his face (sometimes it seems more like a smirk), but he means business. Freddie’s voice rarely appears within the app. MailChimp’s writers should NOT speak in the voice of Freddie or any other chimp.
See our brand assets for more on Freddie.

EEP EEP!
If you’re at all familiar with MailChimp, you’ve heard someone say “eep eep!” as an expression of delight or solidarity. “Eep eep” isn’t chimp talk, and it isn’t Freddie’s voice. It’s our rally cry. We say it when we’re speaking to customers, and we encourage our customers to say it when they’re talking about MailChimp.
